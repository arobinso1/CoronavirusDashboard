    <h1>Robinson Analytics Coronavirus Dashboard</h1>
    <h3>Updated: March 4,2020</h3>
    <p>We thought that we would weigh in on this virus in China and its spread around the world.  In addition to that, we thought
      that we would provide an update on the economy as well.  In this dashboard, we provide you with
      the historical data and also provide you with a forecast.  We include analysis on the growth rate of the virus in Mainland China,
      growth of the virus outside of China, and a current economic forecast of the United States economy by quarter.</p>

  <p>This first chart takes a look at the historical growth of new virus cases in Mainland China and includes a forecast.  As
    you can tell from our analysis, the growth of new cases has leveled off.  Our forecast is more of the same.  It would
    appear that the growth of the virus in China has stabalized</p>

<div class="">
  <p>When we start to look outside of China, we get a different picture.  You can see from the chart above, that virus growth in new cases
  is accelerating outside of China.  When we forecast this growth in new cases out, new cases are growing exponentially.</p>

  <p>In addition to forecasting the Coronavirus outbreak, we thought that we would also forecast GDP by quarter for this year;
  since this outbreak is having an effect on the economy.  As you can see in the chart above, Robinson Analytics is currently
forecasting 2.02% GDP growth for this first quarter as of this writing.</p>
